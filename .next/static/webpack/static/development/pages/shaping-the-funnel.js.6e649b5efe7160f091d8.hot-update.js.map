And that means asking a lot of powerful questions about potential clients and listening hard to the answers.\nFor instance, let’s say our buyer, our potential client, is a self-operated hospital. They run their own cafeteria and facilities. …or it’s a university that has Sodexo food service running their cafeteria, but they're self-operating in facilities management or a competitor is providing them this service. …or it’s a pharmaceutical company that Sodexo supports in one location but not in others.\nThere’s a gap between what Sodexo can deliver and what Sodexo is currently delivering for that account. So there’s an opportunity for Sodexo to offer new or additional services.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section className=\"flex flex-col lg:flex-row w-full\">\n          <div className=\"w-full lg:w-6/12 p-10 bg-gray-200\">\n            <h3 className=\"text-4xl py-10\">\n            Segmentation\n            & Targeting\n            </h3>\n            <div className=\"mx-auto max-w-xs mb-10\">\n              {/* image goes here */}\n              <img src=\"/media/image-10.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" />\n            </div>\n            <p className=\"text-base max-w-sm py-4 italic font-bold mx-auto text-center\">\n              What's the value of sub-segmentation?\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-base max-w-sm py-4 italic font-bold mx-auto text-center\">\n              How do we use it to pursue segment and NorAm growth strategies?\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-base max-w-sm py-4 italic font-bold mx-auto text-center\">\n              How do we operationalize the sub-segmentation insights?\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"mx-auto max-w-xs mb-10\">\n              {/* image goes here */}\n              <img src=\"/media/image-11.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"w-full lg:w-6/12 px-10 py-20\">\n            <p className=\"text-base p-10 leading-loose\">\n              One of the ways for Sodexo to close this gap is through Segmentation and Targeting; two strategies that give us data-driven insight into clients and the services and offers they might want to purchase. Self-operating is a part of the client’s profile. That tells us something about them.\n              Each Segment will have a number of sub-segments, based on data collected and analyzed about the market and client.  Some sub-segments are more likely to be good targets than others. In the new Acceler8 framework, sub-segmentation helps us identify potential leads and opportunities, which in turn helps us set priority targets for our sales and marketing efforts.\n              Data helps us to organize client needs, priorities, and behaviors into categories and then similar client categories are grouped into clusters. Each cluster is mapped to recommended value propositions, offers, and selling strategies to optimize our sales approach. Accurate data powers our strategies.\n              Currently, a common practice has been to go after whatever opportunities surface, which doesn’t help us focus our efforts or to strategically shape our pipeline.\n              Sub-segmentation, targeting, and prioritization shape our marketing and sales efforts and help us pursue our North America growth strategies.\n              After the sub-segmentation is determined by the Segent CEO and the Segment strategy office, lists of priority accounts are identified and communicated to sales leadership. The segment leadership communicates the priorities to the field sales force, as well as the strategic rationale behind the priorities.\n              Now field sales can go and execute on that strategy, focusing on the right targets and using the profile data to shape their own sales approach.\n              This process makes the sub-segmentation actionable at both the strategic and tactical level.\n              And that relates to one of the KPIs we’re defining for the Acceler8 effort: % of pipeline in priority sub-segments.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAgBA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
