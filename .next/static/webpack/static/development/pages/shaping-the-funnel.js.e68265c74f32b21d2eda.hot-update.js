Key decision-makers and strategic teams have been doing basic research and developing plans that set the growth strategy and targets for each Segment. These include the teams who did the market research behind Segmentation, Targeting, and Buyer\u2019s Journey Based on the research, Segment leaders have made key decisions about market sub-segmentation, a list of priority accounts by territory, and pricing strategies for competitive excellence. The research and strategic thinking help us focus our sales and marketing efforts, as well more accurately shape specific commercial strategies and support more flexible and responsive solution development. These priorities and strategies set the stage for the story that follows. One of the goals of the Acceler8 effort is to get more efficient and focused about what leads and opportunities we pursue. And that means asking a lot of powerful questions about potential clients and listening hard to the answers. For instance, let\u2019s say our buyer, our potential client, is a self-operated hospital. They run their own cafeteria and facilities. \u2026or it\u2019s a university that has Sodexo food service running their cafeteria, but they're self-operating in facilities management or a competitor is providing them this service. \u2026or it\u2019s a pharmaceutical company that Sodexo supports in one location but not in others. There\u2019s a gap between what Sodexo can deliver and what Sodexo is currently delivering for that account. So there\u2019s an opportunity for Sodexo to offer new or additional services."))), __jsx("section", {
