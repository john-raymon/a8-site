Each Segment will have a number of sub-segments, based on data collected and analyzed about the market and client.  Some sub-segments are more likely to be good targets than others. In the new Acceler8 framework, sub-segmentation helps us identify potential leads and opportunities, which in turn helps us set priority targets for our sales and marketing efforts. Data helps us to organize client needs, priorities, and behaviors into categories and then similar client categories are grouped into clusters. Each cluster is mapped to recommended value propositions, offers, and selling strategies to optimize our sales approach. Accurate data powers our strategies. Currently, a common practice has been to go after whatever opportunities surface, which doesn\\u2019t help us focus our efforts or to strategically shape our pipeline. Sub-segmentation, targeting, and prioritization shape our marketing and sales efforts and help us pursue our North America growth strategies. After the sub-segmentation is determined by the Segent CEO and the Segment strategy office, lists of priority accounts are identified and communicated to sales leadership. The segment leadership communicates the priorities to the field sales force, as well as the strategic rationale behind the priorities. Now field sales can go and execute on that strategy, focusing on the right targets and using the profile data to shape their own sales approach. This process makes the sub-segmentation actionable at both the strategic and tactical level.
